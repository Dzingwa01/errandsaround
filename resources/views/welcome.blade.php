        <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you â€“ you should make sure therefore
            that you read them carefully before using the app. Youâ€™re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part
            of the app, or our trademarks in any way. Youâ€™re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the
            app, and you also shouldnâ€™t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
            app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights
            related to it, still belong to ERRANDS AROUND.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>ERRANDS AROUND PTY LTD</strong> is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
            possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at
            any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very
            clear to you exactly what youâ€™re paying for.

            Disputes arising from from consumer rights, legal obligation or from law regarding the services will be
            resolved between the E-rounders and the Jumper.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>ERRANDS AROUND PTY LTD</strong></strong> will not be responsible for any damages to property between

            The Errands Around app stores and processes personal data that you have provided it, in order to provide our
            Service.
            Itâ€™s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
            not jailbreak
            or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
            official operating
            system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise
            your phoneâ€™s security
            features and it could mean that the Errands Around app wonâ€™t work properly or at all.

            You should be aware that there are certain things that <strong>ERRANDS AROUND PTY LTD</strong> will not take
            responsibility for.</p>
        <p>Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can
            be Wi-Fi, or provided
            by your mobile network provider, but <strong>ERRANDS AROUND PTY LTD</strong> cannot take responsibility for
            the app not working at
            full functionality if you donâ€™t have access to Wi-Fi, and you donâ€™t have any of your data allowance left.
        </p>
        <p>
            If youâ€™re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
            with your mobile
            network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of
            data for the duration
            of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, youâ€™re accepting
            responsibility
            for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
            region or country)
            without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which youâ€™re using the
            app, please be aware
            that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

        </p>
        <p>
            Along the same lines, ERRANDS AROUND (PTY) LTD cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app
            i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged â€“ if it runs out of battery and you canâ€™t turn it
            on to avail the Service, ERRANDS AROUND (PTY) LTD cannot accept responsibility

            With respect to <strong>ERRANDS AROUND PTY LTD</strong>â€™s responsibility for your use of the app, when
            youâ€™re using the app, itâ€™s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated
            and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it
            available to you.
        <p><strong>ERRANDS AROUND PTY LTD</strong> accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience
            as a result
            of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on â€“ the requirements for
            system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and
            youâ€™ll need to
            download the updates if you want to keep using the app. </p>
        <p><strong>ERRANDS AROUND PTY LTD</strong> does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is
            relevant to you
            and/or works with the version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
